Open:
- when many channels are joined the window will grow out of screen.
- when multiple frontends are connect a remoting exception occurs sometimes and
  kills all remoting clients except one. (Mono bug?)
- when putting special chars in the config (like UTF-8) the config will loose
  on the next start.


Fixed:
- write away message to query page, not server page
- "/connect  foo" throws exception
- umlauts corrupts textview (Gtk# wants UTF-8)
- userlist too small
- Entry History is upside down
- click in textbuffer should focus to entry field
- _Event_NICK collision problems?
- textview should not have any selections!
- ' ' exception in Command()
